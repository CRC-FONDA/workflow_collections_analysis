Description in github repository:
    Papermill demo
    This repository contains a demo of Papermill running on NeSI.
    The goal is to demonstrate how to use it to run non-interactively a series of notebooks on an HPC plateform.

Description of Papermill:
    Papermill is a tool for parameterizing and executing Jupyter Notebooks.
    Papermill lets you:
        parameterize notebooks
        execute notebooks
    This opens up new opportunities for how notebooks can be used. For example:
        Perhaps you have a financial report that you wish to run with different values on the first or last day of a month or at the beginning or end of the year, using parameters makes this task easier.
        Do you want to run a notebook and depending on its results, choose a particular notebook to run next? You can now programmatically execute a workflow without having to copy and paste from notebook to notebook manually.


problem with reproduction:
    Cloned without problem. Created conda environment from file.
    But then we are supposed to install a particular jupyter kernel for the nootebooks. This demo is meant to run on a NeSI cluster
