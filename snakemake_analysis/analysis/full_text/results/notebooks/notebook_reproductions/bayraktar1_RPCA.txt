1. repository cloned

2. I am meant to edit the config file, but have no idea what the paths should be
    I seem to be missing input again

    also unclear what parameters I should pass to singularity:
How to run
Set parameters in config.yaml
run: snakemake -p --use-singularity --singularity-prefix "resources"  --singularity-args "--bind *" --use-conda -j ** all --configfile "config/config.yaml"
Note * : You should provide your own directory for the --bind command so that the data is accesible from the singularity containers.
Note ** : Specify number of available threads here.

3. I tried to run the workflow without specific parameters, but I am missing any input

4. The github repository also notifies us about extremely long running times of workflow
    (8 hours for Covid DNA, multiple days for human DNA)
