level 1:
    cluster 0: 644
        Unclear pattern.
    cluster 1: 21
        Shell lines contain "mkdir" and "RiboReport/scripts/[...].py" scripts.
    cluster 2: 10
        Shell lines gzip their input files (not all rules that do this are in this cluster).
    cluster 3: 178
        Degenerate cases where shell liens are "shell:\'\'\'".
    cluster 4: 6805
        Big group of unclear patterns.

for level 2 we did a clustering on cluster 0 and cluster 4 grouped together
level 2:
    cluster 0: 1
        Singular example.
    cluster 1: 152
        Shell lines use "bcftools" with some parameters. Sometimes other tools such as "samtools", "rbt" are used as well.
    cluster 2: 79
        Degenerate cases where shell lines are "shell:""""
    cluster 3: 7210
        Big group of unclear patterns.
    cluster 4: 7
        Shell lines unzip their input.

for level 3 we did a clustering on cluster 0 and cluster 3 grouped together
level 3:
    cluster 0: 49
        Shell lines call "Rscript".
    cluster 1: 7013
        Big group of unclear patterns.
    cluster 2: 136
        Few lines shell rules. Often they contain "samtools", sometimes "fastqc", "tabix", "python", "bwa-mem2" or other opreators.
    cluster 3: 12
        Single shell line starting with "\'ln -rs "$(dirname "{input}")". Sometimes with some output file after it.
    cluster 4: 1
        Singular example.

for level 4 we did a clustering on cluster 1, 2 and cluster 4 grouped together
level 4:
    cluster 0: 215
        Pipe stuff into log ("2> {log}")?
    cluster 1: 1
        Singular Example.
    cluster 2: 2
        Two examples latched onto "{input.script} {input.atacSCE}"
    cluster 3: 136
        Samtools, pigz, often with index and maybe the common link is "{input]"?
    cluster 4: 6796
        Big group of unclear patterns
