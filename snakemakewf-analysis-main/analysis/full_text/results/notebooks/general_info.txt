A number of the notebook instances are just direct copies of each other:

The following set of repos contain exactly the same notebook rules and notebooks
(in the data analysis I only record them once)
(9 copies, one repo name suggests Bodenmiller as origin)
    BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationSnakemake
    yplakaka/imcsegmentation
    yplakaka/imc
    Masteryuanli/snakerTest
    troy-layouni/CellSegTest
    apoire27/BodennmillerPipeline
    Masteryuanli/snaktest
    Zhanmengtao/ImcSegmentationSnakemake
    Roett/ImcSegmentationSnakemake
The copied notebook rules are noteworthy as they occur in nested if else blocks and appear to skip a step in the workflow;
    if included the first notebook ruleprovides data to the second notebook rule


COMBINATION OF RESULTS:
15 repos (23 with clones)
for now info without clones:
    2 repos, no rules/notebooks
    13 repos, 34 rules/notebooks
out of those 34 rules/notebooks (each notebook can be paired up to a specific rule executing it)
    positions within workflow:
        notebook rule only supplies output to all rule: 22
        notebook rule within the workflow: 5
        notebook rule with unclear position: 7
    types of notebook mentions:
        notebook as input file and executed in shell script: 3
        notebook keyword with notebook-log: 17
        notebook keyword without notebook-log 14
    types of notebooks:
        plotting results: 17
        plotting results and evidently providing output-data: 4
        only displaying results (as pandas dataframes): 3
        providing output data without plotting: 8
        unclear substantial work: 2
    notebook language:
        python: 31
        R: 3

Median:
1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7
