1. The repo is deprecated and no longer maintained. It has been replaced by a dockerized version.

2. After installing a number of dependencies the workflow executes, but throws an error:
(latest_snakemake) seb@Ras:~/Fonda/notebook_reproduction/ImcSegmentationSnakemake$ snakemake --use-conda -n --use-singularity
Building DAG of jobs...
MissingInputException in rule download_example_data in line 605 of /home/seb/Fonda/notebook_reproduction/ImcSegmentationSnakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
Missing input files for rule download_example_data:
    output: resources/example_data
    affected files:
        polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/mxuWXq98MbYHgq2/download

3. The link https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/mxuWXq98MbYHgq2 is dead

4. I tried simply deleting the dead link from the config file, leading to error:
ValueErrorin line 602 of /home/seb/Fonda/notebook_reproduction/ImcSegmentationSnakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)

  File "/home/seb/Fonda/notebook_reproduction/ImcSegmentationSnakemake/workflow/Snakefile", line 602, in <dictcomp>

4.1 These are not two resources, but a resource name, meant to be taken from that url
    I run into a missing input error I don't know how to fix
